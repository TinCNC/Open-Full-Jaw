# CarGen - A direct geometry processing cartilage generation method

## About
This is a copy of CarGen (short for Cartilage Generation) repository which is a python-based code to generate subject-specific cartilages given the bone geometries. For reproducibility of our work, a copy of CarGen is added to our repository to ensure that our users will be using the same version of the code for the PDL rim generation step.

For further details on [CarGen](https://github.com/diku-dk/CarGen) please check its GitHub page.
